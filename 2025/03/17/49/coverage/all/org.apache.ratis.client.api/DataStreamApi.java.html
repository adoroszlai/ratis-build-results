/**
 * Stream data asynchronously to all the servers in the {@link org.apache.ratis.protocol.RaftGroup}.
 * Clients may stream data to the nearest server and then the server will forward the data to the other servers.
 * Once all the servers have received all the data of a request,
 * the leader (may or may not be the nearest server) creates a log entry with a data ID generated by the state machine.
 * Then, the leader sends the log entry to the followers.
 * Since the followers already have received the data from the stream,
 * they may lookup the data from the ID.
 *
 * Since this API allows clients to send data to the nearest server which is not necessarily the leader,
 * this API is more efficient for network-topology-aware clusters
 * than the other APIs that require clients to send data/messages to the leader.
 *
 * Note that this API is different from {@link MessageStreamApi} in the sense that
 * this API streams data to all the servers in the {@link org.apache.ratis.protocol.RaftGroup}
 * but {@link MessageStreamApi} streams messages only to the leader.
